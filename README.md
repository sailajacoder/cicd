🔧 From Code to CI/CD: Simulating Real-World Software Workflows

🧠 Coding isn’t just about writing logic — it’s about building scalable, structured systems that teams can actually collaborate on.

Under the mentorship of my guide at Innomatics, I recently worked on a project that gave me a real taste of professional software development workflows — from abstraction to versioning to CI/CD simulation.

Instead of just coding features, I followed the actual pipeline used in software and data teams 👇





✅ How It Works in Real Teams



🔹 Senior Developer creates the architecture using an abstract base class (Version1.py) — this acts as the blueprint.



🔹 Junior Developer (me!) inherits and implements the actual logic (Version2.py) — following structure strictly.



🔹 The final user simply runs a clean command-line interface (main_version2.py) — no need to understand internal code.





🔁 Versioned Development Flow – Just Like in Companies

1️⃣ V1: Senior Dev designs abstract structure ➝ pushes to GitHub

 2️⃣ V2: Junior Dev clones ➝ implements logic ➝ pushes update

 3️⃣ V3: Senior Dev adds new feature skeleton ➝ commits Version 3

 4️⃣ V4: Junior updates logic accordingly ➝ syncs back to repo



🧠 What I Learned:



1. Why abstraction matters in scalable, collaborative codebases



2. How CI/CD pipelines actually begin — with clean structure & versioning



3. The importance of writing CLI-friendly code that’s intuitive for users



4. Real teamwork simulation using GitHub, modular design, and parser args



🛠 Technologies & Concepts Used:



1. Python OOP with Abstract Base Classes (abc)



2. Helper functions and modular design



3. argparse for CLI-based execution



4. Git & GitHub for team collaboration



5. YOLOv8 for object detection



🙌 A huge shoutout to my mentor and the team at Innomatics for creating such a real-world, career-ready learning experience.

✅ Version1.py – Abstract class

✅ Version2.py – Child implementation


✅ main_version2.py – Command-line interface in action
