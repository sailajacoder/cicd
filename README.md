‣‣‣ Real-World Software Pipeline Simulation using Python Abstraction
This project simulates a real-world development workflow commonly used in software engineering, data engineering, and machine learning teams. It's designed to mirror professional CI/CD practices, with a strong focus on code structure, abstraction, versioning, and team collaboration.

‣‣ Project Objectives
Learn how to:

‣📦 Structure and modularize code across team roles

‣🧩 Use abstraction for clean, scalable integration

‣🔁 Apply real-world versioning and GitHub-based CI/CD workflows

‣🛠️ Build a pipeline that works seamlessly via the command line interface (CLI)

‣‣📌 Project Workflow

| Role                   | Responsibility                                      | File               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| 👨‍💻 Senior Developer | Designs the initial abstract skeleton               | `Version1.py`      |
| 👩‍💻 Junior Developer | Inherits structure and implements the working logic | `Version2.py`      |
| 🧪 End User            | Runs the integrated CLI pipeline                    | `main_version2.py` |

‣‣🔁 Versioned Development Flow

| Version | Owner      | Description                                     |
| ------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| V1      | Senior Dev | Abstract class structure (`Version1.py`)        |
| V2      | Junior Dev | Implements logic using the abstract base        |
| V3      | Senior Dev | Adds new abstract methods for extended features |
| V4      | Junior Dev | Implements new features defined in V3           |
