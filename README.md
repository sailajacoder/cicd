🚀 Real-World Software Pipeline Simulation using Python Abstraction
This project simulates a real-world software development pipeline, showcasing how software, data engineering, and ML teams collaborate through structured, versioned, and abstracted codebases.

The primary goal is to demonstrate:

✅ How code is structured and divided across teams

✅ How abstraction ensures clean integration and extensibility

✅ How GitHub workflows can mimic real-world CI/CD pipeline

Role	Responsibility	File
👨‍💼 Senior Developer	Designs abstract skeleton using base classes	Version1.py
👨‍💻 Junior Developer	Inherits and implements core logic	Version2.py
🧪 User/Tester	Executes complete pipeline via CLI	main_version2.py
🔁 Versioned Development Flow

Version	Role	Description
V1	Senior Dev	Abstract base class structure (Version1.py)
V2	Junior Dev	Implements logic over V1 skeleton (Version2.py)
V3	Senior Dev	Adds new abstract methods for extended features
V4	Junior Dev	Implements V3 methods to support new features
🧰 Technologies & Concepts Used
🔹 Python OOP with Abstract Base Classes (abc)

🔹 Modular, readable, and scalable code structure

🔹 User-friendly Command-Line Interface (CLI) via argparse

🔹 Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration

🔹 Object Detection using YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)

✨ Designed to be intuitive: the user can run the full pipeline without needing to read the internals.

📦 How to Run This Project
Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VodnalaNaveen/cicd.git cd your-repo-name

Step 2: Install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Run the pipeline from the command line
python main_version2.py --image_path="sample.jpg" --model_path="yolov8n.pt"
